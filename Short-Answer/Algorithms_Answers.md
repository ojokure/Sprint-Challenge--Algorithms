#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

linear time O(n) because as n increases a increases

b)

logarithmic time O(nlog n) because n is halfed as j increases on the second loop

c)

linear time O(n) because n reduces each time the recursive call is made

## Exercise II
